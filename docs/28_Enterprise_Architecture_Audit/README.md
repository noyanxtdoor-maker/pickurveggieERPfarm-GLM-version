# 28 — Enterprise Architecture Audit

**Status:** Audit complete (Phases 0–7) — remediation pending
**Branch of record:** `architecture-audit`
**Auditor role:** Chief Enterprise Architect & System Auditor
**Mandate:** Validate the entire V3 architectural foundation (all 28 documentation domains, `00`–`27`) **before production coding begins**, and maintain a permanent engineering audit & remediation history.

This package is the official, long-term enterprise architecture audit history of PickUrVeggie ERP V3. Each phase is captured as its own artifact and committed to `architecture-audit`. Existing documentation is treated as **claims to be verified, not facts**.

---

## Operating constraints

- All audit work occurs on `architecture-audit`. No merges into `develop` or `main`.
- No production source code is modified.
- The V1 prototype (`PickUrVeggieFarm-OLD`) is **read-only historical reference**, consulted only when a phase explicitly requires historical comparison and the owner approves.
- Findings are presented for review at the end of each phase; the artifact is then written and committed before the next phase begins.

## Severity classification

| Severity | Meaning |
|---|---|
| **Critical** | Foundation-breaking; will cause data loss, security breach, or make V3 implementation unsafe to start. |
| **High** | Serious architectural weakness; must be resolved before the affected module is built. |
| **Medium** | Real risk or inconsistency; should be resolved during planning, not deferred to implementation. |
| **Low** | Minor defect or gap; low blast radius. |
| **Improvement Opportunity** | Not a defect; an enhancement that raises enterprise quality. |

## Finding status lifecycle

| Status | Meaning |
|---|---|
| **Open** | Identified, not yet triaged by the owner. |
| **Accepted** | Owner agrees it is valid and in scope to remediate. |
| **Resolved** | Remediated and verified. |
| **Rejected** | Owner has decided not to act (with rationale). |

## Finding record structure

Every finding records: **Finding ID · Severity · Status · Description · Business Impact · Security Impact · Scalability Impact · Technical Risk · Recommended Enterprise Solution · Related Documents · Recommended Priority · Future Action Required.**

Finding IDs are namespaced by phase: `P0-01`, `P1-03`, `P3.5-02`, etc.

All five owner decisions remain **open** (Phase 7 §6). Conflicts register & per-item status: [Stage A artifact §4](Stage_A_Governance_Reconciliation.md).

**Readiness verdict ([Phase 7](Phase_7_Synthesis_and_Remediation_Roadmap.md)):** 0 Critical · 19 High · 28 Medium · 7 Low · 5 Improvement. **Conditionally ready to proceed to a Foundation-Design stage — NOT ready to begin module coding** until the High-severity foundation specs (RLS, money precision, indexing/partitioning, balance snapshots, data migration, DR mechanics, governance reconciliation) are authored. No Critical defects; the vision is sound; the enforcement/precision/scale specs are what's missing.

| Resolved (Stage A / B) | 44 |
| Rejected | 1 |

> Updated by the [Stage B Completion Readiness Review](Stage_B_Completion_Readiness_Review.md) (fresh verification corrected 8 stale-status findings). **0 Critical · 0 Category-A blockers.** The 12 Open are Category B (resolved during Stage C–E) or Category C (low-risk accepted debt); the 2 Accepted (P2-01, P3-03) are direction-ratified with low residual risk. **Verdict: Ready for Stage C.**

> "Resolved (Stage A)" = documentation-level remediation complete and committed on `architecture-audit`. CI automation (index-freshness + link-integrity checks) is specified in the [index strategy](Stage_A_Documentation_Index_Strategy.md) for a later infrastructure change. P2-08 was **Rejected** as a false positive ("V2" in 22.13 = Budget Version 2).
