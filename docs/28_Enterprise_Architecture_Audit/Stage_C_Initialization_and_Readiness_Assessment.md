# Stage C Initialization & Readiness Assessment — Enterprise Engineering Preparation Gate

**Type:** Engineering-preparation gate (entry to Stage C) · **Status:** Complete
**Date:** 2026-06-20 · **Branch:** `architecture-audit`
**Authority basis:** ADR-001, ODR-001…005, Stage A, Stage B (B1–B8), Stage B Completion Review.
**Scope note:** documentation/governance only. **No production code, schema, migrations, or implementation created.** This document *defines* the Stage C roadmap; it does not execute it.

Stage C answers a different question than the audit did. The audit asked *"what should PickUrVeggie ERP become?"* Stage C asks *"how do we ensure every future line of code obeys the enterprise architecture?"*

## 1. Repository verification (read-only)

| Check | Result |
|---|---|
| Active branch | `architecture-audit` ✅ |
| Working tree | Clean (no uncommitted work) ✅ |
| Remote | `origin` → `github.com/noyanxtdoor-maker/pick-ur-veggie-farm` ✅ |
| Branches (local) | `architecture-audit`, `develop`, `main` |
| Branches (remote) | `origin/architecture-audit`, `origin/develop`, `origin/main` (HEAD→main) |
| `develop` HEAD | `03ae96f` — **unchanged** ✅ |
| `main` HEAD | `7833c9f` — **unchanged** ✅ |
| Audit branch ahead of `develop` | 34 commits (all documentation) |
| `src/` changes across entire branch vs `develop` | **0** — production source untouched ✅ |
| **Push status** | ⚠️ **18 local commits unpushed.** `origin/architecture-audit` exists but is 18 commits behind local; most of Stage A/B is **local-only**. |

> **BEFORE the 2026-07-08 boundary decision (see `Phase_2_Context_Reset_Handoff.md §15`):** The `Remote` row above reflected the state on 2026-06-20 — `origin` pointed at `github.com/noyanxtdoor-maker/pick-ur-veggie-farm` (repo A). As of 2026-07-08, repo A is **DISREGARDED** and `origin` has been repointed to `github.com/noyanxtdoor-maker/pickurveggieERPfarm-GLM-version` (repo B, canonical). This table is preserved as a historical snapshot; do not read the `Remote` row as a current-state claim. The current remote binding is `origin` → repo B.

**Integrity conclusion:** No production branch modified. No uncommitted work. Repository is safe to continue. **One data-safety risk:** the bulk of the enterprise foundation work exists only on this machine. Given the project's "if I lose data, I'm dead" principle, **pushing `architecture-audit` to GitHub is strongly recommended** before Stage C (owner action — not performed automatically).

## 2. Architecture package verification

`docs/28_Enterprise_Architecture_Audit/` — **28 files, all present and intact:**

- **Audit Phases 0–7:** Phase_0, 1, 2, 3, 3.5, 4, 4.5, 5, 6, 7 (10 docs) ✅
- **ADR-001** ✅
- **ODR-001…005** (5 docs) ✅
- **Stage A:** Governance Reconciliation + Documentation Index Strategy (2 docs) ✅
- **Stage B1–B8** (8 specs) ✅
- **Stage B Completion Readiness Review** ✅
- **README** (master findings register + trackers) ✅

No missing or orphaned artifacts.

## 3. Authority verification

| Authority | Status |
|---|---|
| Canonical technical authority — Sections **10–26** | Established (ADR-001); foundation re-scoped via additive banners |
| Historical/conceptual — Sections **00–08** | Preserved as vision/history; defer to enterprise on technical conflict |
| ADR-001 (architecture ratification) | In force |
| ODR-001…005 (owner decisions) | All approved/in force |
| Stage A precedence model (TIER 0–6) + authority map | In force; intra-enterprise order set by ODR-004 |
| Locked Design Registry — `13.02` | Single canonical registry (A2) |

**Unresolved authority conflicts:** **None.** P1-01 (precedence) is Resolved; the two Accepted findings (P2-01 dual-layer content, P3-03 role-name spelling) are direction-ratified editorial residuals with no operational authority conflict. The governance hierarchy is unambiguous for implementation.

## 4. Audit debt — fresh recount & Stage-C classification

**Recount (verified against the register, not assumed):** Resolved **44** · Accepted **2** · Rejected **1** · Open **12** = **59**. Critical: **0**.

The 12 Open + 2 Accepted, classified for Stage C:

### Stage C blockers (would make engineering preparation unsafe)
**NONE.** No Open item touches a security/financial/data-loss control that is unspecified — those are all Resolved by B1–B8. Engineering preparation is safe to begin.

### Stage C tasks (become part of Stage C work)
| Finding | Sev | Becomes |
|---|---|---|
| P5-05 | Med | Scaffolding the Supabase/RLS/auth foundation → **C2/C3** |
| P2-04 | Med | CI link-integrity check + link backfill → **C6** |
| P5-03 | Med | Do-not-port enforcement (no plaintext/role-name auth) → **C7 (Engineering Constitution)** |
| P5-01 | High | V3 build *begins* in Stage C (foundation), completes in Stage D → tracked from **C8** |

### Stage D / Production tasks (safely deferred)
| Finding | Sev | Deferred to |
|---|---|---|
| P4.5-07 | Med | Time-series/large-object storage lifecycle — before heavy media/IoT volume (Stage D/E) |
| P3.5-07 | Imp | Large-object/IoT retention + legal-hold (Stage D/E) |
| P4.5-09 | Imp | Load/performance test **execution** (Stage E pre-production gate) |

### Governance/editorial upkeep (low risk; anytime)
P0-04 (numbering gaps), P0-05 (`26`/`27` READMEs), P1-03 (rule consolidation), P1-05 (apex promotion), P2-06 (§12 vs §24/§22.10 overlap), and the 2 Accepted (P2-01 content de-dup, P3-03 role-name spelling). None blocks Stage C; resolved during ongoing documentation upkeep.

## 5. Stage C readiness verdict

> ## ✅ READY to begin Stage C (Engineering Preparation)
> Repository integrity verified, architecture package complete (28/28), authority hierarchy unambiguous, **0 Critical, 0 Stage-C blockers.** Engineering preparation may begin.

**Allowed in Stage C:** development environment, Supabase provisioning, migration governance, git governance, testing architecture, CI/CD gates, the Engineering Constitution, and the executable implementation sequence — i.e., C1–C8 below (definition + setup of *guardrails and tooling*, not business features).

**Still prohibited (unchanged):** business-module development, React components, API endpoints, business database tables, Supabase business-schema implementation, migrations of business entities, backend services, mobile app implementation. Production/module coding (Stage D) requires a separate gate after Stage C guardrails are in place and Category-B items close.

**Recommended pre-Stage-C action:** push `architecture-audit` to GitHub (§1) to remove the single-copy data-loss risk.

## 6. Stage C scope definition (roadmap — defined, not executed)

Sequenced so guardrails exist before anything they guard.

- **C1 — Enterprise Development Environment & Toolchain:** environment tiers (dev/staging/prod); local setup rules + reproducible onboarding; **secrets management** (no secrets in repo, `.env` discipline, `.env.example` as the contract); dependency policy (pinned versions, audited additions — ponytail principle: no dependency for what a few lines do); package governance (approved libraries, license check); toolchain (TypeScript, lint/format, the existing Vite baseline).
- **C2 — Supabase Enterprise Foundation:** environment separation (separate projects per tier); Auth architecture setup per B7/ODR-003; database ownership boundaries per B6 (one owner per domain); `service_role` discipline per B1 §9; Supabase governance (who provisions, who holds keys).
- **C3 — Database Migration Governance:** migration tooling + ordering per `18.05`/`27.03`/ODR-004; **naming conventions**; rollback philosophy (forward-fix + reversible migrations; never edit applied history); seed-data rules (roles/permissions/currency master as seed, B1/B2); schema approval workflow. Foundation invariants baked into migration #1: B2 money types, B3 indexes + partition-readiness, B6 append-only audit, B1 RLS enabled deny-by-default.
- **C4 — Git Repository Governance:** branch strategy (build on `18.07`); protected `main`/`develop`; PR workflow (templates exist in `.github/`); review requirements (≥1 reviewer, spec-conformance check); release strategy.
- **C5 — Testing Architecture:** test pyramid + the mandatory foundation gates — **Security:** RLS cross-tenant negative tests + tenant isolation (B1); **Financial:** money precision / no-float + ledger debit=credit (B2); **Offline:** idempotency / exactly-once + sync correctness (B5); plus snapshot rebuild determinism (B4), audit immutability (B6), migration reconciliation (B8).
- **C6 — CI/CD Quality Gates (block merge on failure):** test success; security validation (RLS-enabled lint, cross-tenant tests); documentation integrity (INDEX freshness + link-integrity — closes P2-04); migration validation; architecture compliance (no-float-money lint, append-only-audit lint, no role-name-auth lint).
- **C7 — Engineering Constitution:** permanent, enforced **forbidden patterns** — float money calculations; role-name authorization (`if role == 'Admin'`); cross-tenant data access; direct cross-module data ownership violations; mutable financial history; audit modification; RLS bypass; plaintext passwords. Each maps to a CI lint (C6) and a B-spec. This is the document that makes the architecture self-enforcing (closes P5-03 enforcement intent).
- **C8 — Enterprise Implementation Sequence:** translate ODR-004 into an executable build roadmap with per-phase entry/exit gates tied to the C5 test gates — Platform Foundation → Core Master Data → Financial Foundation → Operational Engines → Integration & Intelligence → UX & Delivery → Hardening. This is the bridge from Stage C (guardrails ready) to Stage D (module build, separately authorized).

## 7. Recommended Stage C execution order

1. **C7 Engineering Constitution** + **C4 Git Governance** first — write the rules and the workflow before any tooling, so everything after is born compliant.
2. **C1 Environment & Toolchain** + **C5 Testing Architecture** — the local loop and the test gates the rules require.
3. **C6 CI/CD Gates** — automate enforcement of C5/C7 (also closes P2-04 doc-integrity CI).
4. **C2 Supabase Foundation** + **C3 Migration Governance** — provision and define how schema is created safely (foundation invariants from B1–B6).
5. **C8 Implementation Sequence** — finalize the executable ODR-004 roadmap; this is the hand-off point to the Stage D authorization gate.

Rationale (ponytail): rules + tests + CI before infrastructure means the Supabase foundation (C2/C3) is created *under* enforcement, not retrofitted into it.

## 8. Gate outcome

- Repository safe; architecture complete (28/28); authority unambiguous; **0 Critical, 0 Stage-C blockers.**
- **Verdict: Ready to begin Stage C** (engineering preparation). Production/module coding remains gated.
- **Action item for owner:** push `architecture-audit` to GitHub (data-safety).
- **Next:** owner approval to begin **C1** (or the recommended C7+C4 first step). Until then, the project remains in documentation/governance state on `architecture-audit`.
