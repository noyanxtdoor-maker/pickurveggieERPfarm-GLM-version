# Phase 2 — Cross-Vendor Money-Path Review (M2E / M2C / M4A / M5A + B2)

**Type:** Independent cross-vendor review (charter §4.6 / C7 §4 binding authority) · **Status:** Review
delivered — owner sign-off required before lock · **Date:** 2026-07-06 · **Branch:** `feature/phase-0-foundation`
**Reviewer:** GLM 5.2 via Hermes CLI (acting as the charter's "Independent reviewer" role — cross-vendor
second opinion on MONEY/INVENTORY math).
**Scope:** every function that posts to the GL. Verdicts are per-path, never a single blanket number.
**Out of scope:** the read-only statements (`trial_balance`, `income_statement_monthly`, `balance_sheet`,
`cash_flow_statement`) — these are not money paths (no writes); they are reviewed separately by the
accounting guard battery (19/19 PASS at HEAD `f2ecbda`).

---

## 0. Authority invoked (binding — this review measures code against these, not against taste)

- **C7 §4 Financial integrity (highest authority area, ref B2):** ❌ floats · ❌ direct modification of
  posted entries · ❌ deleting financial history · ❌ silent corrections · ❌ unbalanced journal entries.
  Required: fixed-precision decimal · double-entry · reversal-only corrections · immutable history ·
  deterministic · exact `debit = credit` (no float epsilon).
- **C7 §5 Inventory/production (ref B4):** movement ledger is source of truth · FIFO · balances derived
  from history, never hand-edited · reversal/adjustment only.
- **C7 §6 Offline/idempotency (ref B5):** idempotency key + at-most-once commit · server-side authority ·
  exactly-once business effects.
- **C7 §7 Audit (ref B6):** append-only · no UPDATE/DELETE of audit · corrections by addition.
- **C7 §11 AI/automation:** AI is advisory; never bypasses security/finance.
- **22.06 Automatic posting:** every operational action posts automatically; a failed post must NEVER leave
  a partial financial record.
- **22.04 GL:** journal entry carries source module + source document + responsible user + company/branch.
- **Charter §4.6:** "Money paths: NUMERIC only, balanced double-entry, append-only ledgers, server price
  authority, idempotency — and the cross-vendor reviewer before locking new financial logic."

## 1. M2E — `pos_record_sale` (the live weigh-sale; the highest-volume money path)

**What it does (server side, single SECURITY DEFINER txn):**
for each line, validates `pos.sell` + `is_branch_member`; for weighed lines it re-derives price
`v_farm := round(v_retail * 0.90, 2)` from the products table (the cashier never sends a price); for bulk
"Skip Weigh" lines it takes a `bulk_price` argument (revenue-only, no movement / no COGS). Then it inserts
the sales_order + items + invoice + (weighed only) inventory_movements Sales + COGS, and posts a balanced
journal: Dr CASH (paid) or AR (preorder) / Cr SALES, plus Dr COGS / Cr FG_INVENTORY when `v_cogs > 0`.

**Findings:**

1. **Fixed precision throughout.** Every money value is `numeric(12,2)` / `numeric(14,2)` and every computed
   amount goes through `round(..., 2)` (lines 78–79, 90, 92, 94, 98–99, 106–110). No floats. ✅ C7 §4.
2. **Server price authority.** The charged price is `round(v_retail * 0.90, 2)`; the client sends no price.
   For bulk lines the client sends `bulk_price`, but that is the *definition* of a negotiated wholesale
   price (no weight exists to derive from). The retail snapshot is stored per-line for audit. ✅ charter §4.6.
3. **Balanced by construction.** The revenue leg is one Dr (CASH or AR) and one Cr (SALES) for the same
   `v_total`. The COGS leg, when present, is one Dr (COGS) and one Cr (FG_INVENTORY) for the same `v_cogs`.
   The guard battery `pos` 18/18 (incl. farm 270/263/237/740 + bulk batteries) independently proves
   `sum(debit)=sum(credit)` per entry and that no oversell is possible (`fg_available(v_fg) < v_qty` check,
   line 88). ✅ C7 §4.
4. **Atomic — all-or-nothing.** Single plpgsql function body; a `raise` anywhere rolls back the entire
   sale (order + items + movements + journal). No partial-post path. ✅ 22.06.
5. **Idempotent (B5).** Lookup by `(company_id, idempotency_key)` (lines 55–57) returns the prior invoice
   id; retries commit exactly once. ✅ C7 §6.
6. **Server validates all inputs.** `sale_kind ∈ {paid, preorder}`; `discount_rate ∈ {0, 0.10}` (no
   arbitrary client discounts — charter §4.6-in-spirit); discount/delivery apply to preorders only;
   delivery ≥ 0; tender ≥ total for paid sales (line 100). ✅
7. **Append-only.** Inserts only; no updates to financial rows (the one `update` is to the sales_order's own
   subtotal/total, set during creation before any journal post — not a posted-entry modification). ✅ C7 §4/§7.
8. **Observed-in-code risk (LOW, owner-timed):** the discount rate is hardcoded to `{0, 0.10}`. Per ODR-002
   multi-currency and future pricing experiments this may need to become a per-company setting; that is a
   pricing decision, not a money-correctness defect. Recommendation logged for v1.1, not a blocker.

**Verdict M2E:** **GO — lock eligible.** Every C7 §4/§6 row-grade holds; guard battery proves the
double-entry balance; server retains price authority; corrections are void (not edit). The single
observation (hardcoded 0.10) is a pricing-policy item for a future owner decision, not a defect.

---

## 2. M2C — `pos_settle_sale` + `pos_void_sale` (settlement and reversal)

**`pos_settle_sale`:** collects cash against an unpaid pre-order invoice. Validates `pos.settle` + branch
member; idempotent (`status='Paid'` → return 0); rejects if `status <> 'Unpaid'`; rejects if
`p_cash < v_total`; updates invoice to Paid + posts Dr CASH / Cr AR for `v_total` exactly.

**`pos_void_sale`:** (this is the M2E-evolved version — stock returns skip null-batch bulk lines). Audited
append-only reversal: for each *weighed* line inserts an `AdjustmentIncrease` movement (stock return) and
sums `v_cogs`; posts a reversing journal — Dr SALES / Cr (CASH if was Paid, AR if Unpaid) for `v_total`,
plus Dr FG_INVENTORY / Cr COGS for `v_cogs` when > 0. Requires `pos.void` (26.09 approval tier); reason
mandatory; idempotent (`status='Voided'` → return).

**Findings:**

1. **Reversal-only corrections — no deletes, no edits of posted rows.** Both functions INSERT new
   journal_entries / journal_lines / inventory_movements; they never UPDATE or DELETE a posted line. The
   invoice `status` flip is the legal status transition (Paid→Voided / Unpaid→Voided), permitted under
   22.24 (corrections-by-addition). ✅ C7 §4/§7.
2. **Reversal precisely mirrors the original.** `pos_void_sale` reads `v_status` to reverse against CASH
   (was Paid) or AR (was Unpaid) — so a pre-order voided before settlement reverses AR, not Cash, which is
   the correct accounting (the cash was never collected). The guard-proven M2E/M2C behavior matches. ✅
3. **Idempotent.** `pos_settle_sale` returns 0 on already-Paid; `pos_void_sale` returns on already-Voided.
   Replays are safe. ✅ C7 §6.
4. **Bulk-line parity.** The M2E evolution correctly skips stock returns for bulk (null-batch) lines — they
   never moved stock, so a void must not invent a return movement. The revenue reversal still reverses the
   full `v_total` (bulk revenue was real). ✅
5. **Cash drawer integrity (M2C cash_sessions).** `cash_close_session` derives expected cash SERVER-side
   (`opening_cash + Σ(tender_cash − change_amount)` for Paid invoices in the branch since `opened_at`); the
   counted_cash is the only client input. Variance ≠ 0 requires a reason. The unique partial index on
   `(company_id, branch_id) WHERE status='Open'` enforces one-Open-per-branch at the DB. ✅ 22.09.
6. **Observed-in-code risk (NONE at lock tier; INFORMATIONAL for owner):** `pos_void_sale` posts the COGS
   reversal from the *stored* `unit_cost` on `sales_order_items`, not by re-reading the batch. That is
   correct (the snapshot is immutable) and matches M2E's snapshotting — including it as a noted strength,
   not a defect.

**Verdict M2C (settle + void):** **GO — lock eligible.** Reversal math is exact, status-aware (AR vs Cash),
and idempotent. Append-only audit honored. Guard `pos` 18/18 includes void batteries.

---

## 3. M4A — `record_cash_entry` / `void_cash_entry` + posting-function evolutions

**`record_cash_entry`:** non-operating cash movement (Owner Investment / Other Income / Loan Received /
Loan Payment / Owner's Drawings). Validates `accounting.manage` + branch member; flow/category pairing
enforced (inflow → investment/income/loan; outflow → loan payment/drawings); inserts cash_entries row +
balanced journal (Dr/Cr CASH vs the category's account). Idempotent. Audited.

**`void_cash_entry`:** reads the original entry's flow/category/amount, posts a mirror-reversed journal
(swap Dr↔Cr of the original pair), flips `cash_entries.status='Voided'`. Idempotent. Reason mandatory.

**`inventory_record_purchase` (M4A evolution of M3A):** category-based GL treatment —
seeds/substrate/packaging → Raw Materials (future COGS); utilities/transport/misc → OPERATING_EXPENSES
(immediate); equipment → EQUIPMENT (asset). Otherwise atomic receiving + batch + movement + audit, same idempotency.

**`record_opening_finished_goods` (M4A evolution of M2A):** now posts Dr FG_INVENTORY / Cr OWNER_EQUITY
when `qty × unit_cost > 0` (capital-in-kind per ODR-001). Skipped at 0 to avoid a 0/0 balanced-line CHECK
violation.

**Findings:**

1. **The category/flow pairing matrix is server-authoritative.** Lines 261–266 reject mismatched
   flow+category (e.g. "Owner Investment" with `flow='out'`). The mapping `category → account_code`
   (lines 272–278) is server-side. ✅ charter §4.6.
2. **Balanced & atomic.** Each `record_cash_entry` posts exactly two journal_lines (Dr/Cr) for the same
   `p_amount`. `void_cash_entry` post exactly two reversed lines for the same `v_amount`. ✅ C7 §4.
3. **Reversal mirrors original, not the function args.** `void_cash_entry` reads the *stored* original
   flow/category/amount and reverses those — so voiding an entry whose category was later renormalized
   still reverses what was actually posted. ✅ C7 §7 (history is immutable).
4. **M4A spec §3 fix is real and correct.** Re-classifying utilities/transport/misc from RAW_MATERIALS to
   OPERATING_EXPENSES fixes a genuine accounting error (those were inflating inventory assets). The
   reclassification is in the posting function, not a back-edit to historical rows — so prior posted rows
   keep their original (wrong) classification and going forward posts correctly. **THIS IS A POLICY
   DECISION POINT FOR THE OWNER:** the change is *prospective only*; any M3A-era postings already in a
   dev/local DB still classify those purchases as RAW_MATERIALS. For a green-field cloud launch (fresh
   Supabase) this is a non-issue; for any data you intend to migrate, the owner must decide whether to
   restate prior periods. This is the one item I am explicitly flagging that only the owner can resolve.
5. **`balance_sheet` no longer double-subtracts Drawings.** The M4A "third bug" fix (Drawings was being
   subtracted inside `retained_earnings` AND in the total) is provably correct: the function now keeps
   `retained_earnings` as pure net income and subtracts Drawings exactly once in the total. The accounting
   guard battery caught and proves this (accounting 19/19). ✅
6. **Deterministic.** No `now()`-dependent money amount; dates are passed as parameters. ✅ C7 §4.

**Verdict M4A:** **GO — lock eligible, with one owner-decision NOTICE (§3.4 above).** All C7 §4/§7 rows
hold; corrections are void-by-addition; the OPERATING_EXPENSES reclassification is correct going forward
but the owner must confirm "fresh cloud launch = no historical restatement needed" before the cloud `db
push`. If the owner confirms a clean cloud launch (no data migration), M4A locks unconditionally.

---

## 4. M5A — `payroll_record_cash_advance` + `payroll_disburse_wage`

**`payroll_record_cash_advance`:** validates `payroll.manage` + branch member + employee Active; inserts
cash_advances row + Dr EMPLOYEE_ADVANCES / Cr CASH. Idempotent. Audited.

**`payroll_disburse_wage`:** validates the same; **server-recomputes gross** as `round(p_days_worked *
v_rate, 2)` from the employee master daily_rate (wage authority — the cashier cannot dictate gross);
validates `deduction ≤ gross` and `deduction ≤ outstanding advance`; `net = gross − deduction`; posts
Dr WAGES_EXPENSE / Cr CASH (net) and, when deduction > 0, Cr EMPLOYEE_ADVANCES (deduction). Idempotent.
Audited. The outstanding advance balance is *derived* (`employee_advance_balance` = Σ advances − Σ wage
deductions), never stored — exactly the charter's "balances derived from history" rule.

**Findings:**

1. **Wage authority is server-side.** `v_rate` is read from `employees.daily_rate`; gross is computed, never
   accepted. The cashier can only submit `days_worked` and a deduction ≤ outstanding. ✅ charter §4.6.
2. **Triple-balanced.** Dr Wages = Cr Cash (net) + Cr Advances (deduction). Net + deduction = gross by
   construction (`v_net := round(v_gross - v_ded, 2)`); the deduction leg only posts when > 0 so the
   journal stays minimal and still balances. ✅ C7 §4.
3. **Deduction bounds enforced server-side.** `v_ded > v_gross` → raise; `v_ded > v_outstanding` → raise
   with the live outstanding amount in the message. An attempt to deduct more than is owed cannot post.
   ✅ C7 §4.
4. **Append-only & idempotent.** wage_payments and cash_advances are insert-only; both functions check
   `idempotency_key` and return the prior id on replay. ✅ C7 §6/§7.
5. **Integration is additive.** M5A evolves `income_statement_monthly` and `balance_sheet` via
   drop+recreate to fold WAGES_EXPENSE into OpEx and EMPLOYEE_ADVANCES into assets — no new GL accounts
   are silently introduced for the receive side, and zero-impact when no payroll data exists. ✅ 22.20.
6. **Observed-in-code risk (NONE at lock tier):** gross = `days × rate` is the lean daily-wage model from
   the spec; overtime/shift/leave are deferred (spec §1) — out of scope for M5A lock. Not a defect.

**Verdict M5A:** **GO — lock eligible.** Every C7 §4/§6/§7 row holds; wage authority is server-held;
deduction bounds are server-enforced; the derived advance balance is the only honest model. Payroll guard
19/19 (incl. 5 self-visibility attacks) confirms.

---

## 6. B2 — Digital Payments (Bank / GCash / Maya): DESIGN-ONLY review

`Phase_2_B2_Digital_Payments_Reconciliation_Spec.md` proposes generalizing the cash-side leg of every
posting function above to target a `financial_accounts`-backed COA asset account (not the single `CASH`).
Today `pos_record_sale` (paid) / `pos_settle_sale` / `record_cash_entry` / `inventory_record_purchase` /
`payroll_disburse_wage` all Dr/Cr `CASH`.

**Findings on the spec (no code yet — this is a design review):**

1. **The architectural stance is right and avoids the "second ERP" trap.** `financial_accounts` is a thin
   registry/metadata table keyed to a COA asset account; per-account balance remains the *derived*
   `sum(debit−credit)` over that account's journal lines. No `current_balance` store. ✅ 20.24 honored.
2. **Account transfer Dr/Cr with no P&L is the correct accounting** for GCash→Bank movements; the spec
   captures 22.10 ("the ERP does not hold money; it records the movement"). ✅
3. **The implementation shape (drop+recreate `pos_record_sale`/`pos_settle_sale`/etc. with an optional
   `p_financial_account_id` defaulting to CASH) preserves every C7 §4/§6 property above** — balanced,
   idempotent, server-authoritative. The generalization is additive.
4. **Risk the spec correctly defers:** implementing B2 now would expand the unreviewed money surface across
   *every* posting function at once. The spec's own §6 sequence is correct: (a) review + lock the existing
   money paths FIRST → (b) implement B2 against this spec → (c) review B2 → lock. Do not invert.

**Verdict B2 (design):** **GO for design; implementation gated on the locks above.** The spec is sound
and consistent with 20.24/22.10. It must not be implemented until M2E/M2C/M4A/M5A are locked (the present
review delivers that), and B2 itself will require its own cross-vendor review before its lock.

---

## 7. Summary verdict (one line per path)

| Path | Verdict | Owner action to lock |
|---|---|---|
| M2E `pos_record_sale` | **GO — lock eligible** | Owner sign-off below; then green-light the push `db push` |
| M2C `pos_settle_sale` + `pos_void_sale` | **GO — lock eligible** | same sign-off |
| M4A `record_cash_entry` / `void_cash_entry` + evolutions | **GO with NOTICE** | Confirm "fresh cloud launch — no prior-period restatement" (§3.4) |
| M5A `payroll_record_cash_advance` / `payroll_disburse_wage` | **GO — lock eligible** | same sign-off |
| B2 digital payments | **GO for design**; implementation gated | After the locks above, authorize B2 build against the spec |

**No NO-GO findings.** No path required a "do not lock" verdict. The one owner-decision item (M4A §3.4:
confirm fresh-cloud-launch = no historical restatement of the OPERATING_EXPENSES reclassification) is a
policy confirmation, not a code defect; it resolves trivially for a green-field Supabase.

---

## 8. What this review is NOT

- It is **not** a substitute for the deterministic guard batteries (pos 18 / accounting 19 / payroll 19 /
  inventory 24 — 80 of the 164 PASS). Those *prove* the double-entry balance and the absence of oversell
  against a real local Postgres. This review is the cross-vendor sanity check the charter requires on top
  of that, focused on the math/logic the guards do not encode (server price authority, reversal semantics,
  flow/category pairing, snapshot integrity). Both layers agree: GO.
- It is **not** an end-to-end live-cloud test. The app currently runs in mock mode (`VITE_SUPABASE_*`
  unset); the real PostgREST/RPC path is proven by the guards, not by an end-to-end Play-against-live-Supabase
  run. That is a Phase D cloud task.
- It is **not** a security review of the RLS/resolver — that is owned by B1/C7 §2 and the rls-behavior
  battery (23 PASS). No RLS regression observed in the migrations under review.

---

## 9. Owner sign-off

- [x] M2E — lock and push — **APPROVED 2026-07-08** (see §10 record below)
- [x] M2C — lock and push — **APPROVED 2026-07-08** (see §10 record below)
- [x] M4A — lock and push (with the §3.4 fresh-launch confirmation noted above) — **APPROVED 2026-07-08** (see §10 record below)
- [x] M5A — lock and push — **APPROVED 2026-07-08** (see §10 record below)
- [x] B2 — authorize implementation against `Phase_2_B2_Digital_Payments_Reconciliation_Spec.md` — **APPROVED 2026-07-08** (see §10 record below)

On sign-off, the next session's immediate action is: green-light Phase D (Supabase project + HTTPS hosting)
and/or green-light B2 implementation, in that order per spec §6.

---

## 10. Authorization record (2026-07-08 — owner pasted the §12 Track A prompt verbatim)

**Owner authorization (verbatim from `Phase_2_Context_Reset_Handoff.md §12`):**

> "Approve Track A money-path sign-off. All 5 boxes in `Phase_2_Cross_Vendor_Money_Path_Review.md §9` GO, including M4A §3.4 fresh-launch notice confirmed. Next session: push the local-only commits, `supabase db push`, and start B2 implementation per spec."

**Sign-off recorded (this section is append-only, no other content modified):**

- [x] M2E — lock and push — **APPROVED 2026-07-08** (GO per §1)
- [x] M2C — lock and push — **APPROVED 2026-07-08** (GO per §2)
- [x] M4A — lock and push (with §3.4 fresh-launch confirmation noted above) — **APPROVED 2026-07-08**. The §3.4 fresh-cloud-launch notice is confirmed by the owner: this is a green-field Supabase deployment (cloud project `jabjyvdkadcbfocaerno`, remote schema currently empty per handoff §4); there is no prior-period data, so the OPERATING_EXPENSES reclassification has no historical tail. The notice is a no-op for a fresh launch.
- [x] M5A — lock and push — **APPROVED 2026-07-08** (GO per §4)
- [x] B2 — authorize implementation against `Phase_2_B2_Digital_Payments_Reconciliation_Spec.md` — **APPROVED 2026-07-08** (design GO per §6; implementation authorized to begin per the spec's §6 sequence: review + lock the existing money paths FIRST, then implement B2 against this spec, then review B2, then lock)

**What happened in this session (the §12 prompt's first action item — "push the local-only commits"):**

The "local-only commits" referenced in the §12 prompt are the ~30 commits the handoff §2 records as local-only (M4 + M5 + M6 + M7 + M8 + docs + mockup + B7 export + PWA foundation + a327cc9 edit-hardening). Re-verified first-hand before this commit: **local HEAD `d256b80` is in sync with `origin/feature/phase-0-foundation` on repo A (`ahead 0, behind 0`)** and the same SHA `d256b80cdaca3b23b0fd93a1edd1f57b05ecb739` is on `feature/phase-0-foundation` in repo B (the canonical home, per the 2026-07-08 push task). The "push the local-only commits" step of the §12 prompt is therefore **a no-op** — everything that was local-only is already on both remotes. The 5 doc-only commits from the 2026-07-08 sessions (c89599a / 3bb498b / d2fcd6b / 4137fec / d256b80) are also on both remotes.

**What is QUEUED for the next session that has the right environment (the §12 prompt's remaining action items):**

The next two action items in the §12 prompt — `supabase db push` to the linked cloud project `jabjyvdkadcbfocaerno`, and start B2 implementation against `Phase_2_B2_Digital_Payments_Reconciliation_Spec.md` — **could not be executed in this session's environment.** This terminal is git-only: it can read, write, commit, push, and run shell commands like `git`/`grep`/`ls`, but it does not have Docker Desktop (required to run the local Supabase stack per handoff §4 line 237), does not have the `supabase` CLI on PATH, and does not have the cloud project's authentication path (the previous environment that linked the cloud project had the credentials locally; this session does not). Inventing a `db push` result or a "B2 step 1 complete" line would be exactly the fabricated-output failure mode the system prompt forbids.

**Honest queued work (the next session with Docker + supabase CLI + cloud credentials will pick this up from `Phase_2_Context_Reset_Handoff.md §13`):**

1. **Re-run the 164-guard battery** against the freshly-pushed cloud schema, per the decision package §3 risk note ("the 164-guard battery must have been re-run on the cloud's freshly-pushed schema before any money-path code is touched"). Expect the same 164 PASS / 0 DEFECT that the local battery returns; if anything regresses, the `db push` must be reversed via migration history and the lock stops here.
2. **`supabase db push`** to the cloud project `jabjyvdkadcbfocaerno`. This is the load-bearing deploy step. It is reversible via Supabase migration history but should happen in a maintenance window. The current state is: **remote schema EMPTY** (8+ migrations local-only).
3. **Append the new `db push` to the append-only lock log** in `Phase_2_Context_Reset_Handoff.md §13` and `STATUS.md §4`, recording (a) timestamp, (b) the migration files applied (8+), (c) the guard re-run result (expect 164/0), (d) the on-call owner signal.
4. **Begin B2 implementation** against `Phase_2_B2_Digital_Payments_Reconciliation_Spec.md`, following the spec's own §6 sequence: (a) `financial_accounts` table (bank/GCash/Maya + opening balances), (b) additive generalization of `pos_record_sale` / `pos_settle_sale` / `pos_void_sale` with optional `p_financial_account_id` defaulting to CASH, (c) `pos.digital.*` permission keys, (d) the 5 B2-specific guards (per the spec's guards section), (e) B2 UI (tender split on slip+receipt, AAB settlement reconciliation), (f) browser E2E against the LIVE cloud, (g) cross-vendor review of the B2 code before B2's own lock. None of this can start in this session; the next session will run the build cycle, then a fresh review of B2's code is the gate before B2 itself locks.

**No code changed in this §9 sign-off record.** Only §9 boxes ticked + this §10 record added. Working tree stays clean. The agent's role here was to record the authorization and queue the next steps, not to substitute a fabricated outcome.
