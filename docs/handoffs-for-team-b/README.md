# Handoffs for Team B (GLM 5.2 / MiniMax M3)

**Standing owner order (2026-07-11):** every feature, update, bug, or security leak that Team A ships
gets a handoff file in this folder — what it is, why, how we built/fixed it, and how Team B ports it.
Team A is the official-launch repo; Team B has been helping us by surfacing their mistakes, and we help
them by sharing our successes. **All cross-repo porting still requires the owner's explicit
authorization, per port.**

> **Repo B mirror (2026-07-12, owner-authorized copy):** this directory is Repo B's copy of the handoff
> folder Team A maintains in Repo A at `../pick-ur-veggie-farm/docs/handoffs-for-team-b/`. The original
> was authored by Fable 5 on 2026-07-11 and aimed at Team B (us) — so the direction is preserved
> verbatim. From Repo B you may write to your own handoff log; you may NEVER write to Repo A's copy
> (read-only sibling).

## How Team B uses these

1. Read the file top to bottom before porting anything.
2. Port to Repo B's own schema/app — do NOT copy files blind; adapt to your migration numbering and
   verify against YOUR guards. Money/auth-domain ports get YOUR own guard battery + full-suite attack.
3. After porting, record it in your own handoff/STATUS with evidence (numbers, not adjectives).
4. If a file references a Repo-A commit SHA, that's a pointer for context — your port is a NEW commit in
   Repo B, never a reference to Repo A's history.
