-- Migration P1F — Reject a pending signup (owner request 2026-07-13). Companion to P1A's approval queue:
-- until now a pending sign-up could only be approved, never turned away. Authority: B7 §6 (account
-- lifecycle) · C2 §3 (auth ≠ authz) · CLAUDE.md §6 auth tripwire.
--
-- Repo B re-implementation (NOT a clone of Repo A's 20260713090000 — provenance note: authorization
-- 2026-07-15 owner GO "resume all...build,push,commit deploy"; built fresh on Repo B's own chain at
-- timestamp 20260715130000. Behavior identical to Repo A's P1F — same owner spec, same permission gate,
-- same account_status lifecycle state — authored anew on Repo B's schema chain with Repo B's guard).
--
-- Explicitly NOT built here: hard-delete of the user row. public.users (M1) carries its own comment:
-- "Deactivate via account_status; never hard-delete" — and every table added since (audit_events,
-- invoices, journal lines, schedules, projects, employees, invitations, ...) references
-- public.users(id) `on delete restrict`. A hard-delete would either fail with a raw FK error the moment
-- the account has touched anything, or (if forced) silently break the append-only audit trail B6
-- depends on. "Reject" therefore reuses the existing account_status='Suspended' lifecycle state (same
-- one used for the E2E tester suspension) — the identity stops being reachable, stops appearing in the
-- pending queue, and can never self-heal into access, but every FK it participates in stays intact.
--
-- Two pieces:
--  1. reject_pending_user(): membership.manage-gated (same gate as the approve path), only reachable
--     while the target is genuinely still pending (Active, zero memberships) — cannot be repurposed as a
--     generic "suspend anyone" shortcut around the rank-checked revoke path.
--  2. my_account_status(): lets a signed-in identity read its OWN account_status regardless of whether
--     that status is Active or Suspended. Needed because current_app_user_id() (M4) resolves to NULL for
--     a Suspended user by design (B1 §3) — without this, the client cannot tell "still pending" apart
--     from "rejected" and would show the same "hang tight" screen forever to someone who was turned away.
--     Self-only by construction (keyed to auth.uid()); no cross-user data exposure.
